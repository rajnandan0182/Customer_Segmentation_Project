# Customer_Segmentation_Project

## ðŸŽ¯ PS:
 
   Customer Personality Analysis is the process of deeply understanding a companyâ€™s target audience. It enables businesses to identify customer needs, behaviors, and preferences, making it easier to adapt products and services to fit different customer groups.

By segmenting customers based on their characteristics, businesses can design more focused strategies. Instead of promoting a new product to every customer in the database, the company can determine which segments are most likely to purchase and direct its marketing efforts toward those specific groups. This not only improves efficiency but also increases the chances of successful customer engagement.
