# Customer_Segmentation_Project

## ðŸŽ¯ PS:
 
   Customer Personality Analysis is the process of deeply understanding a companyâ€™s target audience. It enables businesses to identify customer needs, behaviors, and preferences, making it easier to adapt products and services to fit different customer groups.

By segmenting customers based on their characteristics, businesses can design more focused strategies. Instead of promoting a new product to every customer in the database, the company can determine which segments are most likely to purchase and direct its marketing efforts toward those specific groups. This not only improves efficiency but also increases the chances of successful customer engagement.

## Data preprocessing & Feature Engineering

1) Handled Missing Values â€“ Imputed null values using the median method.

2) Derived Age Feature â€“ Calculated customer Age from the birth date.

3) Customer Tenure â€“ Created Days_Since_Customer to represent the number of days since enrollment.

4) Family Features â€“ Generated Num_Kids and Fam_Size to analyze household demographics.

5) Campaign Response â€“ Built Num_Accepted, capturing total accepted offers from the last five campaigns.

6) Spending Behavior â€“ Computed MntTotal, representing the total amount spent by a customer in the past two years.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1)  **Box-plot **
   
**We decided not to remove outliers, since the Response column is imbalanced.**

2) **Relation Between Education, Income & Response**

 
3) **Does Recency affect Responses?**
   (Recency is the Number of days since customer's last purchase)

  

4) **How have customers spent in the last two years?**
   
  


5) **Does Family Size affect purchases?**

  

6) Purchases made at stores/website/catalog/discount purchases


7) **Checking for patterns in purchases made through store, website and catalog**
 
8) **Older people have more complaints?/ How have people with complaints reacted towards last campaign?**

 

9) **Regular customers seem to be happy**



10) How do features correlate ?
